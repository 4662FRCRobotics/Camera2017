Raspberry Pi 3B config

Raspbian Jesse Lite: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
also download (for windows) per info on "installation" page: Win32DiskImager 

enable SSH by putting a file named "SSH" on the boot image Micro SD card
-or-
sudo raspi-config
enable SSH
bring up on "console" text mode - no desktop shell
Logon to user Pi at reboot to activate the user crontab
ip address team.11: https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/24193/l/319135-ip-networking-at-the-event
how-to: https://www.modmypi.com/blog/how-to-give-your-raspberry-pi-a-static-ip-address-update
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
interface eth0
static ip_address=10.46.62.11/24
static routers=10.46.62.1
static domain_name_servers=10.46.62.1


install opencv - required for visionb
http://robinhenniges.com/en/install-opencv-for-java-raspberry-pi-debian-jessy
notes
I had to use "sudo" on the "make" command as it was copying modules into restricted folders

for extended options to control GPIO - like the commands to a relay for LED control
pi4j is a Java class lib that provides access to the GPIO executables
install pi4j - http://pi4j.com/install.html
GPIO executables for C++ and Java use
install wiringpi - http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/

executables installed in /home/pi path
command to run vision process needs "sudo" if it's using GPIO (pi4j) code.  Hardware level access requires super-user (root).  In the example code from WPILib, add "sudo" to the front of the "runCameraVision" command.

crontab for user pi added line - only works if "pi" signs on at bootup (per raspi-config above)
# at system boot run the cameravision script with messages to camvis.log and errors to camerr.log
@reboot . ~/runCameraVision 1>camvis.log 2>camerr.log

Driver's Station:
Win32DiskImager
Use Win32DiskImager to create and save full SD images for the pi
<write> - takes an image file (e.g. the Jesse Lite) and creates a boot SD
<read> - backs up a complete SD into a single .img file for later use.  Use this to back up a fully configured SD with vision executable.  That image can be used to clone additional SDs.

PuTTY
	add and save an entry for 10.46.62.11 port 22 to use as SSH client to pi session
	
FileZilla
	use the same port 10.46.62.11 port 22 for SFTP (secure FTP shares secure port with SSH)
	
Eclipse with Remote System Explorer plug-in added
	<help><add new software> 
	select the eclipse download for the current version (2017 - Neon)
	brings up a list of un-installed plug-ins
	filter on "remote"
	look for and select "Remote System Explorer" and "Remote Utilities"
